# MUR Embedded Communication Tests

The `mur_embedded_communication_tests` folder contains a set of Python scripts designed to test the communication systems of the Miniature Underwater Robot (MUR). These scripts simulate various aspects of the MUR's network communication, including sending and receiving UDP packets, checking IP addresses, and processing sensor data through IMU fusion algorithms.

## Overview

The scripts in this folder are primarily used to test and debug the UDP communication capabilities of the MUR. They enable the sending and receiving of data packets, IP address verification, and the processing of sensor data for IMU fusion. This suite of tests ensures that the MUR's networked components function correctly and reliably in different scenarios.

## Scripts Overview

### ipaddress_check.py

- **Purpose**: This script checks and prints the IP address of the machine it is running on. Itâ€™s useful for verifying the network configuration before running other tests.
- **Functionality**:
  - Retrieves the hostname and corresponding IP address of the machine.
  - Handles exceptions if the IP address cannot be determined.

### udp_transmit.py

- **Purpose**: Sends UDP packets to specified IP addresses. This script is used to simulate sending data to the MUR from a remote interface or other networked devices.
- **Functionality**:
  - Defines target IP addresses and UDP port.
  - Sends a predefined message (or sequence of messages) to the target IP(s).
  - Includes options to customize the message content and target IPs.

### udp_receive.py

- **Purpose**: Receives UDP packets on a specified port and prints the received data. This script is essential for validating that the MUR can receive and process incoming UDP packets.
- **Functionality**:
  - Binds to a specific UDP port and listens for incoming data.
  - Prints out the received data and the sender's address.
  - Can be configured to respond to specific conditions.

### udp_server_id_command.py

- **Purpose**: Broadcasts the server ID to all IP addresses listed in a YAML file. This script is useful for dynamically announcing the server's presence on the network without hardcoding IP addresses in the MUR.
- **Functionality**:
  - Loads a list of IP addresses from a YAML configuration file.
  - Sends a server identification message to each IP address in the list at regular intervals.

### udp_timing.py

- **Purpose**: Measures and prints the frequency (in Hz) at which data packets are received. This script is useful for performance testing and ensuring that the MUR's sensors are transmitting data at the expected rate.
- **Functionality**:
  - Receives UDP packets and parses them for specific sensor data.
  - Calculates and prints the data transmission frequency.

### udp_imufusion.py

- **Purpose**: Processes incoming IMU sensor data using the IMUFusion library to calculate orientation (Euler angles). This script demonstrates how to integrate IMU data processing into the MUR's communication system.
- **Functionality**:
  - Receives UDP packets containing IMU sensor data.
  - Uses the IMUFusion library to calculate and print the orientation based on the sensor data.
  - Configurable to focus on specific sensors or data fields.

## Usage

1. **IP Address Check**:
   - Run `ipaddress_check.py` to verify the IP address of your machine before starting any communication tests.

2. **Sending Data**:
   - Use `udp_transmit.py` to send test data to the MUR or other networked devices.

3. **Receiving Data**:
   - Run `udp_receive.py` to listen for incoming data and verify that the MUR is receiving UDP packets correctly.

4. **Server ID Broadcasting**:
   - Execute `udp_server_id_command.py` to broadcast the server's IP address to the MUR, allowing it to dynamically recognize the server on the network.

5. **Timing Tests**:
   - Use `udp_timing.py` to measure the frequency of incoming data, ensuring that the MUR's sensors are communicating at the expected rate.

6. **IMU Data Fusion**:
   - Run `udp_imufusion.py` to process IMU data and calculate orientation in real-time, simulating how the MUR would handle sensor fusion.

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve the robustness of each script by adding more detailed error handling and recovery mechanisms.
- **GUI Integration**: Develop a simple graphical user interface to run these tests more intuitively, especially for non-technical users.
- **Automated Testing**: Implement automated test scripts that can run these communication checks continuously and log the results for later analysis.
